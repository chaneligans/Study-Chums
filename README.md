# Project Description
Study Chums is a web application that connects students of the same major to come together to study. After students sign in through Facebook, they will be able to search for other students within the same major, and request to connect. If both students request to connect with each other, they will receive a notification that they matched. Each studentsâ€™ profiles will contain information such as their name, major, and biography. From there, the students will decide whether or not they would like to contact each other. If they do, they can create a group chat with their matches to form a study group.
